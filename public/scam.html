            <p class="lead">Hello curious üëã</p>
    <h3>The million dollar question! Are crypto currencies a scam?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Traditionally, all currency is issued by governments. It may not have any value other than the fact that society agrees to use it as a means of exchange.</p>
    <p>This is sometimes called as "<i>fiat money</i>" and it gives central banks control about how much money exists in circulation.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, most crypto currencies are not issued by any government and have no legal value. Instead, they exist solely within the bounds of a crypto community.</p>
    <br/>
    <h4>Let's look at an example.</h4>
    <br/>
    <p>You decide that working is for suckers and that instead you should find a way to get rich quick.</p>
    <p>You create your own crypto currency, the <b><i>Gullible-Coin</i></b>.</p>
    <p>You come up with your own clever system to manage the ledger for this coin. Depending on how little you care this can be something similar to Bitcoin's proof-of-work where the environmental impact is the equivalent of dropping napalm all over the Amazon forest.</p>
    <p>Then, you start working on a way to convince others to join your ledger to increase the value of your coin (which currently is zero).</p>
    <p>Maybe you start with your friends, or maybe you go on some social media platform and start boasting about how much money everyone else will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out" target="_blank">missing out</a> on if they don't join you.</p>
    <p>Suddenly a lot of people want in! They start handing you <b>real</b> money and in exchange you write their name in your <b><i>Gullible-Coin</i></b> ledger saying they own x monopoly money.</p>
    <p>And this is where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump" target="_blank">pump and dump</a> starts.</p>
    <p>As more people want in, the ones who already have some monopoly money start asking for higher exchange rates. And of course, because of the fear of missing out, some people will be willing to pay what they ask and the price starts climbing up.</p>
    <p>It creates a snowball effect where the higher the price is, the more people want in and the more money they are willing to pay to get some of the action.</p>
    <p>Eventually it pops.</p>
    <p>A smart percentage will have sold their monopoly money at a profit. Everyone else will be left with Gullible-Coins that no one is interested in buying.</p>
